# DFO_CI_Toolbox
DFO Cumulative Impact Mapping Toolbox (ArcGIS Pro 2.9.8 Python Toolbox) 

This repository contains the code for the Python Toolboxes used to run the DFO Cumulative Impact Mapping analysis (Murray, et al. 2023). 
The files include the .pyt files for each toolbox, the associated .xml metadata files, and a User Guide (.pdf). 

ArcGIS License Requirements to run the toolboxes: ArcGIS Pro Advanced, with Spatial Analyst Extension.  
The python toolboxes have been coded using relative paths - geodatabases must be kept in the same folder as the .pyt files (DFO_CI_Toolbox).  

Sample data can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/AgbayaniS/CIMapping/DFO_CI_Toolbox. 
Please use an ftp client (e.g., FileZilla) to acces the data, or open the link in Windows Explorer (not a web browser).
